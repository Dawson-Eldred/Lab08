This is Dawson and Megan's repo for lab 8

The data is stored in the hash file through a .CSV format. The results_file.csv contains all of the file hashes in the following format:

<file path>,<hash of the file>,<timestamp of the file>

The CSV (Comma Separated Values) format makes it easy to store and process the file in the future since it follows the common format above for each file listing. Using the CSV will make future file processing easy with languages like python.
